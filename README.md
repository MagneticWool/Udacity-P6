# Udacity-P6

## Summary:
My data visualization explores the mean batting averages and mean homerun scores by baseball players as a function of the players being right-handed, left-handed or ambidextrous. The visualization shows that although right-handed players are a majority they have the lowest average homerun score.

## Design:
The visualization should explore the relationship between handedness and results. Bar charts will be used as these are easy to interpret and buttons will change plots.
In my initial draft I included a scatter plot of player heights with a bar chart of weights but feedback made me realize that the data was superfluous to the point being made. I got goog feedback on the bar charts and decided to show all plots this way.

## Feedback:
### Person 1:
Response to initial plot: I like the bar chart but the scatter-stem plot is cramped and confusing  
Response to final plot: Gets straight to the point

### Person 2:
Response to initial plot: OK charts but the top one is weird  
Response to final plot: Looks great and more streamlined. I can see that lefthanded players are better at scoring homeruns.

### Person 3:
Response to initial plot: It seems ok but I cannot see much from the height chart. Can you zoom in?  
Response to final plot: Much more elegant
