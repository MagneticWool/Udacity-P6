Data Visualization

Summary:
My data visualization explores the mean batting averages and mean homerun scores by baseball players as a function of them being right-handed, left-handed or ambidextrous. The visualization shows that although right-handed players are the majority they have the lowest average homerun score.

Design:
Initially I also included a scatter plot of players height with a bar chart of weight but feedback made me realize that the data was superfluous to the point being made.

- explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
